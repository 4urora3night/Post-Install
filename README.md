# Post install Script

⚠️ An new version is in progress ⚠️

This script provides the user with options to install apps on their arch linux computer.
It is designed to be be used with ML4W.
Inspired by ml4w-options :)
To download and run:

1)
```
git clone https://github.com/4urora3night/options.git
```
2)
```
cd options
```
3)
```
./option.sh
```
## NOTES
> As I am a solo dev for this script, I use AI auto-complete on repetitive sections of code to speed up script prodution

> I will build a better script, hopefully 🤞.
## BUGS
>  A few errors when lauched without yay installed
